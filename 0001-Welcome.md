## Introduction to Oskari

Welcome to Oskari's documentation!

Oskari is an open source Web Map Framework. The aim of Oskari is to help organisations to create better map applications to be used on web browsers and mobile devices. Oskari supports EU's INSPIRE directive and OGC standards.

Oskari enables you to create a map service that is either an sample app -based geoportal or a highly customized embedded map.

Oskari enables the user to:
- View spatial data on their web browser
- Combine many different data sources into one map service
- View multiple map layers simultaneously
- Visualizing spatial data
- Embedding user's own maps to other websites as an iFrame
 
Oskari's appearance, UI and functionalities are customizable. The developers can create their own tools, too.

As an open source project Oskari is developed together. The development is coordinated by National Land Survey of Finland. Oskari is dual-licenced MIT/EUPL 1.2.

Note that this document is a work in progress. If you find any outdated information, notice that something is missing or that some sections could be improved, let us know by making an issue in GitHub or a Pull request to the Oskari documentation repository.

If you have further questions or need help with your Oskari instance, see our Contribute and FAQ pages.

## Technological overview

Oskari has a separate backend and a browser-based frontend. 

**The backend** is built on Java with Maven and these are usually run inside Tomcat or Jetty. For caching and clustering Oskari uses Redis. 
The sample server extension can be found [here](https://github.com/oskariorg/sample-server-extension)

**Oskari's frontend** is a JavaScript-based Single Page Application (SPA). Front-end is modular, which makes it easy for developers to mix-and-match and create their own application. Frontend's Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-frontend) 

**The sample application of Oskari's frontend** can be found [here](https://github.com/oskariorg/sample-application)

See also **the unofficial Oskari bundles created by the Oskari community** [here](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-frontend-contrib)

Aside of the frontend and backend, Oskari requires a PostgreSQL database. The scema of database has been documented here. (A mention of spatial data infrastucture in general?)

Previous versions of Oskari required a GeoServer installation, and even though many organisations that use Oskari have a GeoServer instance too, Oskari does not require it anymore. 

The data displayed on the service is fetched from APIs.

## Requirements for developing Oskari

Developer is a person who develops new features or improves existing functionalities in Oskari. An Oskari developer can contribute to Oskari core or Oskari community plugin development.

The requirements for developing the backend and the frontend differ. But which one should you make changes to? As a rule of thumb: 
- If you want to customize the way Oskari looks, what elements and tools are being shown and what they look like, you need to develop **the frontend**. 
- If you want to make completely new functionalities, you have to make changes to **the backend**.

Requirements for developing Oskari:

- Version management: Git
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, React, OpenLayers
- Backend: OpenLayers, Java, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Redis, Jetty/Tomcat
- Build infrastructure & tests: Maven/JUnit for server, Webpack/Jest for frontend.
- Understanding about the following software: PostGIS, Jetty, Redis, GeoServer, Nginx
- Understanding about OGC standards: WMS, WMTS, WFS, WPS, WCS

If you are planning to develop Oskari, don't hesitate to contact NLS FI right at the start. The coordinators from NLS are willing to guide your work and give general guidelines for developing work. Remember **to always document your work** and please use the official Oskari documentation as a reference for your own documentation. As an open source project Oskari requires the contribution of the community that uses it, so please make pull requests to the main Oskari repositories, too.
